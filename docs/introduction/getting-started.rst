Getting Started
---------------

To help you get going we created the spray-template_ project on GitHub. This provides everything you need to get a
*spray* HTTP server application up-and-running in under 5 minutes and view the result in your browser.

Try running one of these examples:

- `spray as a standalone service`_ - this uses the :ref:`spray-routing` and :ref:`spray-can` modules
- `spray inside a servlet container`_ - uses :ref:`spray-routing` and :ref:`spray-servlet` inside a Jetty server

Note: each example lives in its own Git branch of the spray-template project.
