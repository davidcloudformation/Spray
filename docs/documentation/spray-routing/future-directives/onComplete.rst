Description
-----------

The evaluation of the inner route passed to a onComplete directive is deferred until the given future
has completed and provided with a extraction of type ``Try[T]``.

It is necessary to bring a ``ExecutionContext`` into implicit scope for this directive to work.

To handle the ``Failure`` case automatically and only work with the result value, use ``onSuccess``.
To complete with a successful result automatically and just handle the failure result, use ``onFailure``, instead.
