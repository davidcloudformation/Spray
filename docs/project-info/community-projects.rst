Community Projects
==================

Over the course of the last years the active and vibrant *spray* community has created numerous additions and extensions
to *spray* as well as examples and tutorials that, for various reasons, haven't always found their way into the main
codebase.

As *spray* is now transitioning into Akka_ (see also `this post on the typesafe blog`__) we have moved the list of
community projects that formerly resided here into a dedicated section of the Akka "Community Projects" page
at this address:
